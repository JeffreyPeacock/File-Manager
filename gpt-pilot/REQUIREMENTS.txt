I want to create a specialize file-manager application.  It's primary usage is to recursively search a files-system or directory and compute the md5sum for each file it finds, and persist that information to a local database. This information is used to find, track and manage duplicate files across differrent files-systems.

General Implmention Requirements:
1. This app will run locally on the local system.
2. This app will be implementated in Python 3.12.
3. This app will use SQLite as its persistemce store.
4. This app will provide a full featured graphical user-interface that is similar to the Gnome file-manager or Windows Explorer.
5. This app will have a CLI that will accept a finite set of directives that specify specific actions to be completed independent of any graphical user interface.
6. All Python functions must have tests, and in the aggregate must provide at least 95% code coverage. 


Command-line Features:
1.  Given a path to a directory, recursively scan the directory and compute the md5sum for each file and store
    the md5sum and the path into the DB
2.  Given a path to a file, compute the md5sum and store the md5sum and the path into the DB.
3.  Given a path to a file, compute its md5sum and report if the file is a duplicate of a
    file already recorded in the DB.
4.  Given a path to a directory scan the directory, caclculate the md5sum and record the md5sum file path into the DB
    but and report if any of the files are duplicates of files already recorded in the DB.
5.  Accept an option that will display duplicates in a grapical UI, which will then allows the user to delete the duplicates in bulk (all), or a selected subset.
